# 🃏  Ride the bus – My First Game in GameMaker

This is my very first game project, which I'm creating using **GameMaker**, as a way to learn and practice game development step by step.

## 🎯 What is this game?

It’s a card-based guessing game in four stages. In each stage, the player must guess something about a randomly drawn card:

1. **Game 1**: Guess if the card is red or black.
2. **Game 2**: Guess if the next card is higher or lower than the previous one.
3. **Game 3**: Guess if the new card is between the values of the previous two.
4. **Game 4**: Guess which Ace (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, or Spades) was drawn.

Each correct guess moves the player forward. A wrong guess ends the game with a loss screen and a restart.

## 💡 Why I'm building this

I'm using this project to explore and practice:
- GameMaker’s GML scripting
- Object-based game structure
- GUI elements and buttons
- Card logic and randomness
- Managing game state across multiple phases

It's 100% a learning project — things are constantly changing, breaking, and getting fixed. I'm having fun building it and figuring things out along the way.

## 🎮 What I'm learning

Through this project, I'm learning how to:
- Use global variables and custom object events
- Structure gameplay flow across rounds
- Display sprites, UI, and animations
- Handle user input and timing
- Debug and polish a project step by step

## 🛠️ Tools

- [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/)
- GML (GameMaker Language)
- Custom sprites
- Keyboard + mouse input

## 🚧 Project status

This project is still a work in progress. I'm actively adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving the code as I learn more.
